      <h2>6A. Märzen</h2>
      <p><strong>Overall Impression:</strong> An elegant, malty German amber lager with a clean, rich, toasty and bready
        malt flavor, restrained bitterness, and a dry finish that encourages another drink. The overall malt impression
        is soft, elegant, and complex, with a rich aftertaste that is never cloying or heavy.</p>
      <p><strong>History:</strong> As the name suggests, brewed as a stronger “March beer” in March and lagered in cold
        caves over the summer. Modern versions trace back to the lager developed by Spaten in 1841, contemporaneous to
        the development of Vienna lager. However, the Märzen name is much older than 1841; the early ones were dark
        brown, and in Austria the name implied a strength band (14 °P) rather than a style. The German amber lager
        version (in the Viennese style of the time) was first served at Oktoberfest in 1872, a tradition that lasted
        until 1990 when the golden Festbier was adopted as the standard festival beer.</p>

      <h2>6B. Rauchbier</h2>
      <p><strong>Overall Impression:</strong> An elegant, malty German amber lager with a balanced, complementary
        beechwood smoke character. Toasty-rich malt in aroma and flavor, restrained bitterness, low to high smoke
        flavor, clean fermentation profile, and an attenuated finish are characteristic.</p>
      <p><strong>History:</strong> A historical specialty of the city of Bamberg, in the Franconian region of Bavaria in
        Germany. Beechwood-smoked malt is used to make a Märzen-style amber lager. The smoke character of the malt
        varies by maltster; some breweries produce their own smoked malt (rauchmalz).</p>
